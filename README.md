The JenkinsSample

This is a sample project to demonstrate building a C# project in Jenkins and running tests.

The sample now uses a [Jenkins shared library](https://github.com/FineRedMist/jenkins-shared-library-groovy) which is also public to for building. This project can be forked (I don't recommend relying on it directly, as it would be running code you haven't reviewed).
